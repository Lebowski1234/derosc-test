Purpose of tests: see what happens when multiple calls are made to the same function in the SC quickly. Is data stored as expected?


Expected behaviour: Data is stored correctly. 

Actual behaviour: Data is stored correctly in first block after RPC calls, but then the data changes in subsequent blocks without any additional RPC calls being made.

Steps to reproduce: Check out .txt file for description of testing process and results. I can provide more details if required.
